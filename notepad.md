// win condition?
// hole in one, matching interval with power thats has leeway of +10%, with correct degree,
// if ball = hole 



// stretch condition 1, getting "different clubs" for chipping and putting
// stretch condition 2, getting putting as its own shooting game within the game but with a smaller grid.






this bar needs to get the distanceToHole[x] 
i need it fit whtin 100%



the interval goes up from 1-100 and then back down
850 --> 100%, 10% 850, 20% of 850 ~

x = 850

make interval goes up and down

24% = 204yd

100% power interval  ==.01 ~ 1

interval = ()


also plotting out points on canvas is confusing.



power bar is made, 
but need to finesse when clicking "swing" - line 12
