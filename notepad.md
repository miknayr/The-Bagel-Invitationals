// win condition?
// hole in one, matching interval with power thats has leeway of +10%, with correct degree,
// if ball = hole 



// stretch condition 1, getting "different clubs" for chipping and putting
// stretch condition 2, getting putting as its own shooting game within the game but with a smaller grid.




5/14 10pm update;
- added random number generators for both the starting tee (bottom square) and the hole (top square)
- added random number generators for both tee box (bottom square) and the green box (top square)
- added "the brendan" to figure out the distance to the hole for gauging "power" (pythagorean theorem via brendan)
- bottom of code has "ball" class constructor to check out and integrate
- cleaned up code to be more efficient
