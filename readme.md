# The Bagel Championships

This is a golf game. 
taking in judgement, precision, and interpretation to get a hole in one.

# About
For this project, I plan on making a simple golf game, using linear algebra and simple math.
Everybody loves to play virtual golf even if they dont enjoy golf itself. This game gives you the opportunity to test your skills of judgement and navigation to get a hole-in-one!!


# Wireframe
![Alt text](images/bagel_WF-1.png?raw=true "golf wireframe")

# Tech being used
- HTML/CSS/Javascript
- HTML 5 canvas

# MVP Goals
- [x] Having the formula for game logic (gauging distance + angle = hole location) work as intended.
- [x] being able to play the game from top down map only
- [ ] render the starting screen at the teebox
- [ ] render swing animation (two frames)
- [ ] render the "ball" going short, long or in the hole via ball animation
- [ ] use keyboard keys to allow choosing direction of attack and to control power.
- [ ] When getting a hole-in-one, having an audible queue (ball landing in the hole) and celebration
- [ ] if you "miss", having the power bar adjust for the distance remaining from ball to hole location



# Stretch Goals
 - [ ] Add ambient sounds
 - [ ] Being able to "select your club", being able to choose club distance
 - [ ] stylizing the game to be fluid with 3 different animations. one for swing (two frames) one for ball travel, and one for visual landing of ball whether its over, under, or in!

 - [ ] document UX testing and create UX case study with feedback

- [ ] mega stretch goal. Being able to convert putting into a minigame inside of the game. creating a smaller canvas that has challenges of the lie (things that affect the ball angle and speed?) 


 - [ ] mega stretch multiplayer capability to compete against your friend online

- [ ] generating random fairways, hazards and bunkers?
- [ ] creating formulas for how field conditions (fairway, rough, bunker) affect the distance/power
- [ ] creating a 3 hole course

# Roadblocks 
I think for me, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the integration of how all this comes together... so thats a road block all on its own.
I dont know how to actually get a "ball" to "go into the hole".

linking all the javascript coding together 

understanding how objects might interact with each other?
for example; having the ball interact with the hole, and when they "collide" it creates a success (weston has hit detection)






scaling the code? to be different formats? or how is canvas affected by screensize, and minimum req.


For styling, I'm planning on trying to have simple illustrations that generally show whats going on, or pulling different assets from the web that already exist. I'm not sure exactly which tech stack works for this but I plan on using the one that mostly allows for this idea to come to life.
