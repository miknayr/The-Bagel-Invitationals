- added random number generators for both the starting tee (bottom square) and the hole (top square)
- added random number generators for both tee box (bottom square) and the green box (top square)
- added "the brendan" to figure out the distance to the hole for gauging "power" (pythagorean theorem via brendan)
- bottom of code has "ball" class constructor to check out and integrate
- cleaned up code to be more efficient


5/15 11pm update;
- added colors on greens and teebox,
- added power bar and determined its value
- added start/stop function on click
- need to figure out how to bring function outside of click

- next steps are to create a object(circle/ball) and apply math formula
- dealing with if 
- ((.01% x swingPower) x distanceToHole) > 95% x distanceToHole = true


5/15 1130pm update;
- we have a "working" game! open console to see your results when you click "swing"
